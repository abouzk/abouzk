# Hi there, I'm Karim Abouzeid 👋

### Computer & Systems Engineer | Sim-to-Real Architect | Trilingual (German/English/Arabic)

I am a Systems Engineering student at **RPI** focused on **Safety Architectures** and **Robotics Simulation**. My goal is to bridge the gap between high-level path planning and low-level hardware safety, specifically for medical and industrial applications.

Currently designing the **Digital Twin for the Mercer X Lab**, translating abstract kinematic theory into real-time, safety-critical control loops.
